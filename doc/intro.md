# Introduction to cljtable
- Writes Are sequential and single threaded
- All writes are done against the active segment
- Active segment is finalized after some predicate holds true
- There is one Active Segment and zero or more Read Only segments at a given time
- All segment have in memory key-offset indexes
- During writes, indexes are maintained
- After restart, indexes are re-created in memory
- Uses Nio for writes
- Uses nippy for serialization
-- TODO make pluggable
- Uses Disk for writes
-- TODO make pluggable, support offheap
- deletes are marked with tombstones, should be cleaned up when merging
-- TODO merge read-only segments on background
